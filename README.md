Don't Starve mod to restore Reign of Giant Soundtrack in Shipwrecked.

The following is a maintenance doc, mostly for myself because I keep forgetting how to do all of this ;-)

## Install and test manually

See [this post](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/29657-how-to-install-and-use-mods/).

For a typical steam installation, you must copy this folder to `/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/dont_starve/mods`.

## Publish

Use "Don't starve mod tools".
